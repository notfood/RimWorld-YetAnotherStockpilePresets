&lt;size=20&gt;Simple Stockpile Presets&lt;/size&gt;

A mod that adds various presets for stockpile settings in a comfortable float menu. You can use them to easily set often used storage configurations, both generic ones (like freezer stuff) and specific ones (like food, drugs, weapons or clean apparel).

This is a QOL mod, no content added or changed. To use it, just make a stockpile and select a preset.

You can edit them through xml, they use the RimWorld filter syntax.
