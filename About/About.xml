&lt;size=20&gt;Yet Another Stockpile Presets&lt;/size&gt;

A mod that adds various presets for stockpile settings from a comfortable float menu. You can use them to easily set often used storage configurations, both generic ones (like freezer stuff) and specific ones (like food, drugs, weapons or clean apparel).

This is a QOL mod, no content added or changed. To use it, just make a stockpile and select a preset.

You can edit the present through xml, idealy you write your own patches to this mod or add more files, they use the RimWorld filter syntax.

Fork from Simple Stockpile Presents.

Multiplayer enabled!
